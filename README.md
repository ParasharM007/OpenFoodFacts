## Development Time
It took me around 4 days to create this project.

## Approach
In this project,
I have used React for the smooth rendering of each component.
I have used proxy feature of react to avoid re-writing the base URL, allowing me to focus on the specific endpoints for the API.
You can find all dependencies in package.json file.

## Installation
To set up this project locally...,
You just have to download node_modules separately and whole code is provided in github link.
Also make sure to connect your device to Internet while using and making api calls.
